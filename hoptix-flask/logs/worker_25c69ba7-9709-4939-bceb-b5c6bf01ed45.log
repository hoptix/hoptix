There was one valid upsizing opportunity on the cone because the customer did not specify a size; instead of offering the large as required, the operator asked an open question, which falls under an invalid upsizing offer and resulted in no size upgrade. No upselling opportunities existed for the items chosen, but the operator also failed to suggest the valid add-on of a double-dip for the cone. To improve, the operator should: 1) use the correct suggestive phrasing such as Would you like that large today? when size is not given, 2) remember cone add-ons like a double dip, and 3) close the upsell by confirming benefits and pricing. Doing so would increase ticket averages without prolonging order time.', 'issues': 'Upsizing reference: Scenario VO-09 (cone, size not mentioned) and Scenario IO-02 (asked what size—invalid). Add-on reference: Menu JSON, Dipped Cone Add on Chance: Double Dip. No upsell chances per menu JSON and Upselling Scenarios table. Ambiguities: customer said box of bars; interpreted as Box of 6 Dilly Bars per menu since Dilly Bar is the only bar listed with a box option. Item count treated as six individual bars plus one cone, following meal-item counting guidance.', 'reasoning_summary': '', 'gpt_price': 0, 'video_file_path': '', 'video_link': ''}
