## Key Metrics Explained

### Upselling Metrics
- **Opportunities**: Number of times an upsell could have been offered
- **Offers**: Number of times an upsell was actually offered
- **Successes**: Number of successful upsells (customer accepted)
- **Success Rate**: Successes / Offers * 100
- **Offer Rate**: Offers / Opportunities * 100
- **Conversion Rate**: Successes / Opportunities * 100

### Upsizing Metrics
- **Largest Offer Rate**: Percentage of upsize offers that mentioned the largest option
- All other metrics same as upselling

### Add-on Metrics
- Same structure as upselling metrics
- Tracks additional toppings, sides, and extras

## Python Usage

```python
from services.analytics_service import HoptixAnalyticsService

# Initialize service
analytics = HoptixAnalyticsService()

# Load your transaction data (from CSV export or database)
transactions = [...]  # Your grading data

# Generate comprehensive report
report = analytics.generate_comprehensive_report(transactions)

# Get item-specific report
blizzard_report = analytics.get_item_specific_report(transactions, "blizzard")

# Access specific metrics
print(f"Upsell success rate: {report['upselling']['success_rate']:.1f}%")
print(f"Top recommendations: {report['recommendations'][:3]}")
```

## Data Input Format

The analytics service expects transaction data in the format exported by the grading CSV, with these key fields:

```json
{
  "Transaction ID": "uuid",
  "Date": "MM/DD/YYYY",
  "Complete Transcript?": 1,
  "Items Initially Requested": "[\"22_1\", \"36_1\"]",
  "# of Items Ordered": 2,
  "# of Chances to Upsell": 2,
  "# of Upselling Offers Made": 1,
  "# of Sucessfull Upselling chances": 1,
  "# of Chances to Upsize": 1,
  "# of Upsizing Offers Made": 1,
  "# of Sucessfull Upsizing chances": 0,
  "# of Chances to Add-on": 1,
  "# of Add-on Offers": 0,
  "# of Succesful Add-on Offers": 0
}
```

## Item Code Format

Items are referenced using the format `{ITEM_ID}_{SIZE_ID}`:
- `22_1`: Small Blizzard
- `22_2`: Medium Blizzard  
- `22_3`: Large Blizzard
- `36_1`: Single Burger
- `25_2`: Regular Fries

## Running the Example

```bash
cd hoptix-flask
python analytics_example.py
```

This will generate a sample report and save it to `analytics_report.json`.

## Integration with Your Workflow

1. **After CSV Export**: Use the `/analytics/comprehensive` endpoint to analyze your latest grading results
2. **Daily Reports**: Set up automated calls to `/analytics/summary` for daily performance tracking  
3. **Item Performance**: Use `/analytics/items` to identify which menu items need training focus
4. **Trend Analysis**: Use date filters to compare performance over time periods

## Performance Tips

- Use `run_id` filters to analyze specific batches of transactions
- Use `item_filter` to focus on specific menu categories
- The `limit` parameter helps manage response size for item analytics
- Cache results for frequently accessed reports
