Cones do not carry an upsell path to a combo or meal, so there were no upselling chances either. The operator therefore had no required suggestive-selling actions, and none were attempted. One minor missed opportunity was the optional extra-topping offer (extra sprinkles) that the framework allows for cones, but topping offers are a low-value add-on and omission does not impact core metrics. Overall, the call was handled correctly and efficiently, with accurate order confirmation and proper total given.",

    "General Feedback": "The operator completed the basic order-taking steps but missed all suggestive selling opportunities linked to a $7 Meal Deal. Company standards call for offering to make the drink and fries large and for upgrading the small sundae to a small Blizzard. No such offers were made, so two upsizing chances were missed. Additionally, when the guest declined the drink, the operator simply accepted instead of clarifying that a beverage is included in the meal and offering alternatives such as bottled water or a different flavor, which could have preserved the full value of the deal and guest experience. Strengths: polite greeting, confirmed sauce and dessert flavor, and brief closing. Improvement points: always follow the VO-07 script for the $7 Meal Deal\u2014Would you like your drink large or upgrade your sundae to a Blizzard?\u2014and reinforce the included beverage rather than removing it. Also, proactively offer any applicable toppings for the sundae such as whipped cream or nuts.",

    "General Feedback": "Operator missed an upsell to the 2 for $5 promotion on the pretzel and did not properly attempt to upsize the Blizzard. Asking what size the Blizzard should be is classified as an invalid upsizing offer, so it does not count toward offers made. No upselling or upsizing conversions were achieved. Operator also failed to suggest any additional toppings; the customer had to request the chocolate cone dip themselves. Strength: confirmed ability to add requested topping and provided total promptly. Improvement: Use scripted phrasing such as Would you like to add a small sundae or any size drink to make that 2 for $5? and Would you like that Blizzard large today? to capture sales opportunities.",

Invalid upsizing wording classified via Upsizing Scenario IO-03. Difficulties: The transcript did not explicitly state Blizzard size initially, requiring assumption of small per rules.

    "General Feedback": "Operator missed all four valid upsell chances presented by the two stand-alone hot dogs (offer fries, drink, or make a combo) and did not suggest any extra topping for the Pumpkin Pie Blizzard. No upsizing chance existed because the Blizzard was ordered small and hot dogs have no size. Remember: after each stand-alone sandwich or hot dog, offer to make it a meal or add side and drink; for Blizzards without extra topping, suggest an add-on; always follow VO-03 phrasing for hot dog combos. Donation request was good, but revenue-driving suggestive selling needs improvement.",
    "Response Difficulties": "Upsell chances sourced from Upselling Scenarios VO-03 (hot dog -> combo) and Hot Dog menu item ID 42 which lists Drink and Fries add-ons. Additional topping chance taken from Blizzard item ID 22 Add on Chance \"Primary Topping\". No upsizing chance per Note that size was specified. Difficulties: transcript speaker labels reversed (\"Operator\" lines actually customer); term \"pumpkin pie burger\" interpreted as Pumpkin Pie Blizzard (seasonal menu) since no such burger exists. No item IDs exist for toppings, so row 19 left 0 despite one chance.",

    "General Feedback": "The operator correctly confirmed the small size Blizzard and the total but missed the opportunity to offer extra mix-ins or toppings, which is the only valid add-on for a Blizzard in this scenario.

Upselling possibilities confirmed as 0 for Blizzard (Menu Items JSON). Upsizing ruled out via Upsizing Scenarios: Scenario Null-02 (specific size given).

    "General Feedback": "The operator accurately clarified the $7 Meal Deal options and collected the customer\u2019s drink and sundae choices, but missed all revenue-building opportunities. A $7 Meal Deal allows one upsizing chance (upgrade the included small sundae to a Blizzard) and one add-on chance (offer premium toppings such as whipped cream). No valid upsizing phrasing\u2014e.g., Would you like to turn that sundae into a small Blizzard for a little more?\u2014was used. The brief mention of chocolate sauce was phrased as a flavor check, not a priced add-on, so it counts only as an additional topping offer and was declined. There were no combo or drink-upsell chances because the meal already bundles those items. To improve, the operator should: 1) use the VO-07 script every time a $7 Meal Deal is ordered; 2) explicitly offer the Blizzard upgrade and large drink; 3) phrase topping offers as value-added, not flavor confirmation; 4) record acceptance or decline clearly before closing the order. This would increase upsell, upsize, and topping conversions while following DQ suggestive-selling best practices.",

Difficulties: 1) VO-07 mentions both large drink and Blizzard upgrade but the Meals JSON lists only the Blizzard upgrade; followed rule to prioritise table data and counted one upsizing chance. 2) Chocolate sauce is not explicitly listed in add-on toppings, but treated as a topping consistent with Sundae item notes. 3) Drink-size upsize ambiguity resolved by using Meals JSON which excludes it. All counts cross-checked against hard-rule constraints.",

    "General Feedback": "The operator missed every clear upselling and upsizing opportunity. Two single Original Cheeseburgers automatically generate two combo-type upsell chances each (fries and drink), but the operator merely confirmed condiments and moved to the total instead of offering to make either or both burgers a combo or even suggesting a side or drink. No 2-for-$5 add-on was suggested either. The shake size was specified as small, so no legitimate upsizing chance existed, but the shake does carry an add-on chance (extra malt or flavor); none was offered. Strengths: friendly greeting, correct order repeat-back, and confirmation of whipped cream. Areas to improve: 1) always look for combo upsell on any burger or hot-dog order; 2) when a customer orders an eligible 2-for-$5 item, suggest a second qualifying item; 3) remember add-on upsells such as extra malt with shakes; 4) phrase upsells correctly (\"Would you like to make those burgers a combo with fries and a drink today?\").

    "General Feedback": "Operator provided friendly service but missed several suggestive-selling opportunities. After the guest ordered chicken strips and a fry, there was a valid drink and dessert upsell chance as outlined for chicken strips, yet no offer was made and the customer later added the drink on their own. The side of fries also presented a dipping-sauce upsell (Scenario VO-07) that was not attempted. Sizes were locked in as small/regular for both fry and drink without offering large alternatives. Remember to ask: \u201cWould you like to add a drink or make that a basket meal today?\u201d and for fries, \u201cWould you like ranch or gravy with that?\u201d These quick questions boost check average and meet Dairy Queen\u2019s upsell standards.",
    "Response Difficulties": "Upsell opportunities referenced from menu JSON item 30 (3-Piece Chicken Strips) which lists drink and sundae add-on chances, and item 25 (Fries) which aligns with Scenario VO-07 dipping-sauce upsell. Drink item 5 and Sundae item 1 IDs taken from menu JSON. No menu ID exists for dipping sauce, so that potential item could not be encoded in rows 4/7. The customer requested a 2-piece strip (not in menu list); closest valid menu item 30_0 was used to keep IDs correct. \"Small\" fry size was mapped to Regular (size ID 2) because small is not explicitly listed.",

Missed two clear upsizing chances specific to the $7 Meal Deal: offering to make the drink large and to upgrade the sundae to a Blizzard. Customer self-initiated the Blizzard upgrade, so credit cannot be given. No upsell attempts were necessary, but offering extra toppings for the sundae/Blizzard or suggesting additional items such as cookies could have increased ticket. Remember: when a drink or dessert size is not specified, explicitly ask if the guest would like to make it large, and when a $7 Chicken Strip Meal is ordered always ask if they would like to turn the sundae into a Blizzard. Also consider saving donation requests for after all sales opportunities are explored.",

In addition, asking open-ended \u201cAny dipping sauce?\u201d does not count toward the required gravy upsell.

    "Response Difficulties": "Sources: Menu Meals JSON item 1023 (CB Chicken Strip Basket Meal) lists Large Fries and Large Drink as upsizing chances; Upsizing scenarios VO-01/VO-02/VO-04 require explicit offer of the large size for side/drink. Dessert topping options (whipped cream, nuts, sprinkles) pulled from Items JSON for Sundae (Item IDs 1 & 2) and applied to Banana Split, which is not separately catalogued. No applicable upselling scenarios since a full meal was already selected. Issues: Banana Split absent from item list so mapped to Sundae category; topping IDs not provided, so recorded by name. Conflicting instructions on item-ID formatting for toppings vs. integers handled by naming toppings plainly while keeping all integer fields unquoted as mandated.",

    "General Feedback": "The operator greeted the guest politely and clarified the request for extra tartar sauce but did not attempt any suggestive selling. Because the #3 combo was ordered with no size stated, there were two valid upsizing chances (large fries and large drink). No large-size offer was made, so both opportunities were missed and the store lost potential incremental sales and ticket lift. Remember: whenever a combo or meal is ordered without a size, immediately ask if the guest would like to make it a large for a small additional cost. Use clear, value-driven phrasing such as \u201cWould you like to make your fries and drink large today?\u201d This satisfies VO-01 guidelines and improves check average while enhancing guest experience.",
    "Response Difficulties": "Table references: Meals JSON item 1019 (#3 Backyard Bacon Ranch Meal) for initial order; Upsizing Scenario VO-01 (combo, unspecified side/drink) for the two upsizing chances. Difficulties: Transcript mentioned tartar sauce, which typically accompanies fish; however, #3 meal in provided menu table corresponds to Backyard Bacon Ranch, so that item was used to stay consistent with the given data. No upsell scenarios applied once a combo was selected, and condiments are excluded per rules.",

    "General Feedback": "Employee correctly offered an extra-topping add-on for the Blizzard; customer declined. No upselling chances existed because the burger was already taken as a combo. One upsizing chance (asking to make the Backyard Bacon Ranch burger a triple patty per VO-14) was missed, and there were no drink/fries upsizing chances since sizes were specified.

    "General Feedback": "The operator correctly identified and captured all three orders and made one upselling attempt on the Number 5 burger by asking if the guest wanted it as a combo; this was valid wording and the guest accepted, resulting in two successfully-added items (fries and drink). No other valid suggestive selling was attempted: the operator missed three further upsell chances (gravy for the chicken basket and 2-for-$5 tie-ins) and six clear upsizing chances (large drink and Blizzard upgrade on the $7 Meal Deal, large drink and fries on the new Number 5 combo, and large drink and fries on the 4-piece Chicken Strip Meal). No extra-topping offer was made for the strawberry sundae. Strengths: polite, confirmed sauces and flavors, obtained all needed information quickly. Improvement: always offer the largest size (\u201cWould you like to make that a large drink and fries?\u201d), remember gravy with all baskets, and offer the Blizzard upgrade on the $7 Meal Deal or the 2-for-$5 add-on items when applicable. More consistent use of the required phrasing will raise check averages and guest satisfaction.",
    "Response Difficulties": "Upselling opportunities and offers were identified using Upselling Scenarios table: VO-06 (burger to combo) and VO-07 (gravy on chicken basket). Upsizing opportunities referenced Upsizing Scenarios table: VO-02 (drink), VO-04 (side), VO-07 (sundae to Blizzard). Meal and item structures confirmed in the Menu Items JSON (#25 Drink, #1 Sundae, #25 Fries etc.) and Meal JSON (1001 $7 Meal Deal, 1012 #5 Cheese Deluxe combo, 1023 Chicken Strip Basket Meal). Difficulties: menu JSON does not list gravy as a chargeable item so it could not be coded in lines 4/7; 4-piece basket meal size variant not explicitly present\u2014mapped to 1023 as nearest fitting meal. Size defaults (medium drink, regular fries) had to be inferred because customer never stated size. No explicit item ID for Blizzard upgrade topping, therefore additional-topping opportunity recorded but not itemised. ",

    "General Feedback": "The operator was courteous and confirmed the customer\u2019s order promptly, but did not engage in any targeted suggestive selling. There were no valid upsell or upsize chances because the customer specified a small size and dipped cones carry no combo opportunities. However, a single additional-topping opportunity existed (offering a Double Dip on the dipped cone) and was missed. A generic question such as \u201cCan I get you anything else?\u201d does not meet Dairy Queen\u2019s standards for a valid upsell or upsize offer. Future calls should include specific add-on offers (e.g., \u201cWould you like that double-dipped for a richer chocolate coating?\u201d) whenever applicable.",
    "Response Difficulties": "Item data located in Menu Items JSON: Dipped Cone (Item ID 8) shows add-on chance \u201cDouble Dip\u201d and upsizing chance only if size not specified. Upsizing scenarios VO-09 confirm no upsize when small size chosen. No upselling scenarios apply. Ambiguity: customer\u2019s phrase \u201cvanilla and chocolate\u201d could imply Twist Cone, but request for a \u201cdip cone\u201d aligns more closely with Dipped Cone, so the latter was selected.",
