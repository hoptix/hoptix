# Final Pydantic v2 Fix - What Changed

## The Problem

Even the `python:3.10` base image has Pydantic v1 pre-installed **as compiled `.so` files**. Regular `pip uninstall` doesn't remove these compiled binaries, so Pydantic v2 installation fails.

## The Solution

Updated `Dockerfile.porter-only` with aggressive removal and verification:

### 1. **Physical File Deletion**
```dockerfile
rm -rf /usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pydantic*
find /usr/local -name "*pydantic*.so" -delete
```
Physically deletes ALL Pydantic files including compiled binaries before installing v2.

### 2. **Force Reinstall**
```dockerfile
pip install --no-cache-dir --force-reinstall \
    "pydantic==2.9.2" \
    "pydantic-core==2.23.4"
```
Forces fresh installation of Pydantic v2.

### 3. **Immediate Verification**
```dockerfile
python -c "from pydantic import TypeAdapter; print('✓ TypeAdapter available')"
```
Build **FAILS IMMEDIATELY** if TypeAdapter isn't available.

### 4. **Constraint File**
```dockerfile
echo "pydantic>=2.9.0" > /tmp/constraints.txt
pip install --constraint /tmp/constraints.txt -r requirements.txt
```
Prevents any package from downgrading Pydantic during requirements installation.

### 5. **Triple Verification**
- After Pydantic install
- After all requirements
- Final check before user creation

Build will **FAIL** at any stage if Pydantic v2 is not present.

## Why This Will Work

1. **Physical deletion** removes compiled .so files that pip can't touch
2. **Force reinstall** ensures clean v2 installation
3. **Constraints** prevent accidental downgrades
4. **Build-time verification** means if the image builds, Pydantic v2 IS installed
5. **Multiple checkpoints** catch any issues early

## How to Deploy

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Pydantic v2 with aggressive file deletion and verification"
git push
```

Porter will build the image. Check the build logs for:
```
✓ TypeAdapter available
✓ Final check passed - Pydantic 2.9.2 with TypeAdapter
=== BUILD SUCCESSFUL - Pydantic v2 verified ===
```

If you see these messages, the job **WILL WORK**.

## If It Still Fails

If the build succeeds but the job still fails with TypeAdapter errors, then there's a fundamental issue with:
- How Porter runs the container
- Environment variable issues
- Or the base image is caching old files

In that case, we'd need Porter logs showing the EXACT Python path and package locations.
