## Base URL

The Strike Auth Service API is available at the following base URLs:

```
Production: https://auth-api.strike.com
Development: http://localhost:8080
```

## Authentication

Most endpoints require authentication via the `Authorization` header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <jwt-token>
```

Admin endpoints require either:
- Service role key: `Authorization: Bearer <service-role-key>`
- Admin user JWT: `Authorization: Bearer <admin-jwt-token>`

## Request Format

All requests should include the `Content-Type` header:

```http
Content-Type: application/json
```

Request bodies should be valid JSON:

```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "securepassword123"
}
```

## Response Format

All responses are returned in JSON format with consistent structure:

### Success Response
```json
{
  "id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "created_at": "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

### Error Response
```json
{
  "code": 400,
  "msg": "Error description",
  "details": "Additional context (optional)"
}
```

## Rate Limiting

All endpoints include rate limiting headers:

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `X-RateLimit-Limit` | Maximum requests per window |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | Remaining requests in current window |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset` | Time until window resets (seconds) |

When rate limits are exceeded, the API returns a `429 Too Many Requests` status code.

## HTTP Status Codes

The API uses standard HTTP status codes:

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `200` | OK - Request successful |
| `201` | Created - Resource created successfully |
| `400` | Bad Request - Invalid request data |
| `401` | Unauthorized - Invalid or missing authentication |
| `403` | Forbidden - Insufficient permissions |
| `404` | Not Found - Resource not found |
| `429` | Too Many Requests - Rate limit exceeded |
| `500` | Internal Server Error - Server error |

## Pagination

List endpoints support pagination using query parameters:

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `page` | Page number (1-based) | 1 |
| `per_page` | Items per page (max 100) | 20 |

Paginated responses include metadata:

```json
{
  "data": [...],
  "pagination": {
    "page": 1,
    "per_page": 20,
    "total": 100,
    "total_pages": 5
